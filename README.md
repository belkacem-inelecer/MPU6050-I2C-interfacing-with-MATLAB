# MPU6050-I2C-interfacing-with-MATLAB

This Script contain the fully I2C interfacing MATLAB code with Arduino Nano3 microcontroller and MPU6040.
- The IMU module use i2C as a protocol of communication.
- Before running the script, make sure that you have already installed the Arduino Package for MATLAB.
- The output values will be plotted in a Graph.
- The Graph records the X,Y,Z values.
